## [5.3 random â€” Pseudorandom Number Generators](https://pymotw.com/3/random/index.html)

Purpose:	Implements several types of pseudorandom number generators.

The random module provides a fast pseudorandom number generator based on the Mersenne Twister algorithm. Originally developed to produce inputs for Monte Carlo simulations, Mersenne Twister generates numbers with nearly uniform distribution and a large period, making it suited for a wide range of applications.
