## [5.1 decimal â€” Fixed and Floating Point Math](https://pymotw.com/3/decimal/index.html)

Purpose:	Decimal arithmetic using fixed and floating point numbers

The decimal module implements fixed and floating point arithmetic using the model familiar to most people, rather than the IEEE floating point version implemented by most computer hardware and familiar to programmers. A Decimal instance can represent any number exactly, round up or down, and apply a limit to the number of significant digits.
