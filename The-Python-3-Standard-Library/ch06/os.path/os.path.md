## [6.1 os.path â€” Platform-independent Manipulation of Filenames](https://pymotw.com/3/os.path/index.html)

Purpose:	Parse, build, test, and otherwise work on filenames and paths.

Writing code to work with files on multiple platforms is easy using the functions included in the os.path module. Even programs not intended to be ported between platforms should use os.path for reliable filename parsing.
