## [9.2 hmac â€” Cryptographic Message Signing and Verification](https://pymotw.com/3/hmac/index.html)

**Purpose:**	The hmac module implements keyed-hashing for message authentication, as described in RFC 2104.

The HMAC algorithm can be used to verify the integrity of information passed between applications or stored in a potentially vulnerable location. The basic idea is to generate a cryptographic hash of the actual data combined with a shared secret key. The resulting hash can then be used to check the transmitted or stored message to determine a level of trust, without transmitting the secret key.
