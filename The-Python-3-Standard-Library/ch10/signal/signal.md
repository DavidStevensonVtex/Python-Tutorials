## [10.2 signal â€” Asynchronous System Events](https://pymotw.com/3/signal/index.html)

**Purpose:**	Asynchronous system events

Signals are an operating system feature that provide a means of notifying a program of an event, and having it handled asynchronously. They can be generated by the system itself, or sent from one process to another. Since signals interrupt the regular flow of the program, it is possible that some operations (especially I/O) may produce errors if a signal is received in the middle.

Signals are identified by integers and are defined in the operating system C headers. Python exposes the signals appropriate for the platform as symbols in the signal module. The examples in this section use SIGINT and SIGUSR1. Both are typically defined for all Unix and Unix-like systems.

Note

Programming with Unix signal handlers is a non-trivial endeavor. This is an introduction, and does not include all of the details needed to use signals successfully on every platform. There is some degree of standardization across versions of Unix, but there is also some variation, so consult the operating system documentation if you run into trouble.
