## [10.3 threading â€” Manage Concurrent Operations Within a Process](https://pymotw.com/3/threading/index.html)

**Purpose:**	Manage several threads of execution.

Using threads allows a program to run multiple operations concurrently in the same process space.

### 10.3.1 Thread Objects

The simplest way to use a Thread is to instantiate it with a target function and call start() to let it begin working.

```
# threading_simple.py
import threading


def worker():
    """thread worker function"""
    print("Worker")


threads = []
for i in range(5):
    t = threading.Thread(target=worker)
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()
```

The output is five lines with "Worker" on each.

```
$ python3 threading_simple.py
Worker
Worker
Worker
Worker
Worker
```

It is useful to be able to spawn a thread and pass it arguments to tell it what work to do. Any type of object can be passed as argument to the thread. This example passes a number, which the thread then prints.

```
# threading_simpleargs.py
import threading


def worker(num):
    """thread worker function"""
    print("Worker: %s" % num)


threads = []
for i in range(5):
    t = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(i,))
    threads.append(t)
    t.start()
```

The integer argument is now included in the message printed by each thread.

```
$ python3 threading_simpleargs.py
Worker: 0
Worker: 1
Worker: 2
Worker: 3
Worker: 4
```

### 10.3.2 Determining the Current Thread

Using arguments to identify or name the thread is cumbersome and unnecessary. Each Thread instance has a name with a default value that can be changed as the thread is created. Naming threads is useful in server processes with multiple service threads handling different operations.

```
# threading_names.py
import threading
import time


def worker():
    print(threading.current_thread().getName(), "Starting")
    time.sleep(0.2)
    print(threading.current_thread().getName(), "Exiting")


def my_service():
    print(threading.current_thread().getName(), "Starting")
    time.sleep(0.3)
    print(threading.current_thread().getName(), "Exiting")


t = threading.Thread(name="my_service", target=my_service)
w = threading.Thread(name="worker", target=worker)
w2 = threading.Thread(target=worker)  # use default name

w.start()
w2.start()
t.start()
```

The debug output includes the name of the current thread on each line. The lines with "Thread-1" in the thread name column correspond to the unnamed thread w2.

```
$ python3 threading_names.py
worker Starting
Thread-1 Starting
my_service Starting
worker Exiting
Thread-1 Exiting
my_service Exiting
```

Most programs do not use print to debug. The [logging](https://pymotw.com/3/logging/index.html) module supports embedding the thread name in every log message using the formatter code %(threadName)s. Including thread names in log messages makes it possible to trace those messages back to their source.

```
# threading_names_log.py
import logging
import threading
import time


def worker():
    logging.debug('Starting')
    time.sleep(0.2)
    logging.debug('Exiting')


def my_service():
    logging.debug('Starting')
    time.sleep(0.3)
    logging.debug('Exiting')


logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format='[%(levelname)s] (%(threadName)-10s) %(message)s',
)

t = threading.Thread(name='my_service', target=my_service)
w = threading.Thread(name='worker', target=worker)
w2 = threading.Thread(target=worker)  # use default name

w.start()
w2.start()
t.start()
```

[logging](https://pymotw.com/3/logging/index.html) is also thread-safe, so messages from different threads are kept distinct in the output.

```
$ python3 threading_names_log.py
[DEBUG] (worker    ) Starting
[DEBUG] (Thread-1  ) Starting
[DEBUG] (my_service) Starting
[DEBUG] (worker    ) Exiting
[DEBUG] (Thread-1  ) Exiting
[DEBUG] (my_service) Exiting
```
