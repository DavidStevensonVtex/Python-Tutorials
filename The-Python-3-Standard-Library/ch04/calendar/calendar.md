Purpose:	The calendar module implements classes for working with dates to manage year/month/week oriented values.

The calendar module defines the Calendar class, which encapsulates calculations for values such as the dates of the weeks in a given month or year. In addition, the TextCalendar and HTMLCalendar classes can produce pre-formatted output.
