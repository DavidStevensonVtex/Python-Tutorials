## [3.3 operator â€” Functional Interface to Built-in Operators](https://pymotw.com/3/operator/index.html)

Purpose:	Functional interface to built-in operators.

Programming using iterators occasionally requires creating small functions for simple expressions. Sometimes, these can be implemented as lambda functions, but for some operations new functions are not needed at all. The operator module defines functions that correspond to built-in operations for arithmetic, comparison, and other operations corresponding to standard object APIs.
