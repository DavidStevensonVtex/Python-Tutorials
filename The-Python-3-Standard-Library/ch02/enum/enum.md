## 2.1 enum: Enumeration Type

The enum module defines an enumeration type with iteration and comparison capabilities. It can be used to create well-defined symbols for values, instead of using literal integers or strings.

### 2.1.1 Creating Enumerations

A new enumeration is defined using the class syntax by subclassing Enum and adding class attributes describing the values.

```
# enum_create.py
import enum


class BugStatus(enum.Enum):

    new = 7
    incomplete = 6
    invalid = 5
    wont_fix = 4
    in_progress = 3
    fix_committed = 2
    fix_released = 1


print('\nMember name: {}'.format(BugStatus.wont_fix.name))
print('Member value: {}'.format(BugStatus.wont_fix.value))
```

The members of the Enum are converted to instances as the class is parsed. Each instance has a name property corresponding to the member name and a value property corresponding to the value assigned to the name in the class definition.

```
$ python3 enum_create.py 

Member name: wont_fix
Member value: 4
```

### 2.1.2 Iteration

Iterating over the enum class produces the individual members of the enumeration.

```
# enum_iterate.py

import enum


class BugStatus(enum.Enum):

    new = 7
    incomplete = 6
    invalid = 5
    wont_fix = 4
    in_progress = 3
    fix_committed = 2
    fix_released = 1


for status in BugStatus:
    print('{:15} = {}'.format(status.name, status.value))
```

The members are produced in the order they are declared in the class definition. The names and values are not used to sort them in any way.

```
$ python3 enum_iterate.py 
new             = 7
incomplete      = 6
invalid         = 5
wont_fix        = 4
in_progress     = 3
fix_committed   = 2
fix_released    = 1
```

### 2.1.3 Comparing Enums

Because enumeration members are not ordered, they support only comparison by identity and equality.

```
# enum_comparison.py
import enum


class BugStatus(enum.Enum):

    new = 7
    incomplete = 6
    invalid = 5
    wont_fix = 4
    in_progress = 3
    fix_committed = 2
    fix_released = 1


actual_state = BugStatus.wont_fix
desired_state = BugStatus.fix_released

print('Equality:',
      actual_state == desired_state,
      actual_state == BugStatus.wont_fix)
print('Identity:',
      actual_state is desired_state,
      actual_state is BugStatus.wont_fix)
print('Ordered by value:')
try:
    print('\n'.join('  ' + s.name for s in sorted(BugStatus)))
except TypeError as err:
    print('  Cannot sort: {}'.format(err))
```

The greater-than and less-than comparison operators raise TypeError exceptions.

```
$ python3 enum_comparison.py
Equality: False True
Identity: False True
Ordered by value:
  Cannot sort: '<' not supported between instances of 'BugStatus' and 'BugStatus'
```

Use the IntEnum class for enumerations where the members need to behave more like numbersâ€”for example, to support comparisons.

```
# enum_intenum.py
import enum


class BugStatus(enum.IntEnum):

    new = 7
    incomplete = 6
    invalid = 5
    wont_fix = 4
    in_progress = 3
    fix_committed = 2
    fix_released = 1


print('Ordered by value:')
print('\n'.join('  ' + s.name for s in sorted(BugStatus)))
```

```
$ python3 enum_intenum.py 
Ordered by value:
  fix_released
  fix_committed
  in_progress
  wont_fix
  invalid
  incomplete
  new
```
