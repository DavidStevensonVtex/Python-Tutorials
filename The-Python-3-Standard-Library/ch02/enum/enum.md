## 2.1 enum: Enumeration Type

The enum module defines an enumeration type with iteration and comparison capabilities. It can be used to create well-defined symbols for values, instead of using literal integers or strings.

### 2.1.1 Creating Enumerations

A new enumeration is defined using the class syntax by subclassing Enum and adding class attributes describing the values.

```
# enum_create.py
import enum


class BugStatus(enum.Enum):

    new = 7
    incomplete = 6
    invalid = 5
    wont_fix = 4
    in_progress = 3
    fix_committed = 2
    fix_released = 1


print('\nMember name: {}'.format(BugStatus.wont_fix.name))
print('Member value: {}'.format(BugStatus.wont_fix.value))
```

The members of the Enum are converted to instances as the class is parsed. Each instance has a name property corresponding to the member name and a value property corresponding to the value assigned to the name in the class definition.

```
$ python3 enum_create.py 

Member name: wont_fix
Member value: 4
```

### 2.1.2 Iteration

Iterating over the enum class produces the individual members of the enumeration.

```
# enum_iterate.py

import enum


class BugStatus(enum.Enum):

    new = 7
    incomplete = 6
    invalid = 5
    wont_fix = 4
    in_progress = 3
    fix_committed = 2
    fix_released = 1


for status in BugStatus:
    print('{:15} = {}'.format(status.name, status.value))
```

The members are produced in the order they are declared in the class definition. The names and values are not used to sort them in any way.

```
$ python3 enum_iterate.py 
new             = 7
incomplete      = 6
invalid         = 5
wont_fix        = 4
in_progress     = 3
fix_committed   = 2
fix_released    = 1
```

### 2.1.3 Comparing Enums

Because enumeration members are not ordered, they support only comparison by identity and equality.

```
# enum_comparison.py
import enum


class BugStatus(enum.Enum):

    new = 7
    incomplete = 6
    invalid = 5
    wont_fix = 4
    in_progress = 3
    fix_committed = 2
    fix_released = 1


actual_state = BugStatus.wont_fix
desired_state = BugStatus.fix_released

print('Equality:',
      actual_state == desired_state,
      actual_state == BugStatus.wont_fix)
print('Identity:',
      actual_state is desired_state,
      actual_state is BugStatus.wont_fix)
print('Ordered by value:')
try:
    print('\n'.join('  ' + s.name for s in sorted(BugStatus)))
except TypeError as err:
    print('  Cannot sort: {}'.format(err))
```

The greater-than and less-than comparison operators raise TypeError exceptions.

```
$ python3 enum_comparison.py
Equality: False True
Identity: False True
Ordered by value:
  Cannot sort: '<' not supported between instances of 'BugStatus' and 'BugStatus'
```

Use the IntEnum class for enumerations where the members need to behave more like numbersâ€”for example, to support comparisons.

```
# enum_intenum.py
import enum


class BugStatus(enum.IntEnum):

    new = 7
    incomplete = 6
    invalid = 5
    wont_fix = 4
    in_progress = 3
    fix_committed = 2
    fix_released = 1


print('Ordered by value:')
print('\n'.join('  ' + s.name for s in sorted(BugStatus)))
```

```
$ python3 enum_intenum.py 
Ordered by value:
  fix_released
  fix_committed
  in_progress
  wont_fix
  invalid
  incomplete
  new
```

### 2.1.4 Unique Enumeration Values

Enum members with the same value are tracked as alias references to the same member object. Aliases do not cause repeated values to be present in the iterator for the Enum.

```
# enum_aliases.py
import enum


class BugStatus(enum.Enum):

    new = 7
    incomplete = 6
    invalid = 5
    wont_fix = 4
    in_progress = 3
    fix_committed = 2
    fix_released = 1

    by_design = 4
    closed = 1


for status in BugStatus:
    print('{:15} = {}'.format(status.name, status.value))

print('\nSame: by_design is wont_fix: ',
      BugStatus.by_design is BugStatus.wont_fix)
print('Same: closed is fix_released: ',
      BugStatus.closed is BugStatus.fix_released)
```

Because by_design and closed are aliases for other members, they do not appear separately in the output when iterating over the Enum. The canonical name for a member is the first name attached to the value.

```
$ python3 enum_aliases.py
new             = 7
incomplete      = 6
invalid         = 5
wont_fix        = 4
in_progress     = 3
fix_committed   = 2
fix_released    = 1

Same: by_design is wont_fix:  True
Same: closed is fix_released:  True
```

To require all members to have unique values, add the `@unique` decorator to the Enum.

```
# enum_unique_enforce.py
import enum


@enum.unique
class BugStatus(enum.Enum):

    new = 7
    incomplete = 6
    invalid = 5
    wont_fix = 4
    in_progress = 3
    fix_committed = 2
    fix_released = 1

    # This will trigger an error with unique applied.
    by_design = 4
    closed = 1
```

Members with repeated values trigger a ValueError exception when the Enum class is being interpreted.

```
$ python3 enum_unique_enforce.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "enum_unique_enforce.py", line 6, in <module>
    class BugStatus(enum.Enum):
  File "/usr/lib/python3.8/enum.py", line 974, in unique
    raise ValueError('duplicate values found in %r: %s' %
ValueError: duplicate values found in <enum 'BugStatus'>: by_design -> wont_fix, closed -> fix_released
```
