## [2.5 bisect â€” Maintain Lists in Sorted Order](https://pymotw.com/3/bisect/index.html)

Purpose:	Maintains a list in sorted order without having to call sort each time an item is added to the list.

The [bisect module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html) implements an algorithm for inserting elements into a list while maintaining the list in sorted order.

### 2.5.1 Inserting in Sorted Order

Here is a simple example in which insort() is used to insert items into a list in sorted order.

```
# bisect_example.py
import bisect

# A series of random numbers
values = [14, 85, 77, 26, 50, 45, 66, 79, 10, 3, 84, 77, 1]

print('New  Pos  Contents')
print('---  ---  --------')

l = []
for i in values:
    position = bisect.bisect(l, i)
    bisect.insort(l, i)
    print('{:3}  {:3}'.format(i, position), l)
```

The first column of the output shows the new random number. The second column shows the position where the number will be inserted into the list. The remainder of each line is the current sorted list.

```
$ python3 bisect_example.py
New  Pos  Contents
---  ---  --------
 14    0 [14]
 85    1 [14, 85]
 77    1 [14, 77, 85]
 26    1 [14, 26, 77, 85]
 50    2 [14, 26, 50, 77, 85]
 45    2 [14, 26, 45, 50, 77, 85]
 66    4 [14, 26, 45, 50, 66, 77, 85]
 79    6 [14, 26, 45, 50, 66, 77, 79, 85]
 10    0 [10, 14, 26, 45, 50, 66, 77, 79, 85]
  3    0 [3, 10, 14, 26, 45, 50, 66, 77, 79, 85]
 84    9 [3, 10, 14, 26, 45, 50, 66, 77, 79, 84, 85]
 77    8 [3, 10, 14, 26, 45, 50, 66, 77, 77, 79, 84, 85]
  1    0 [1, 3, 10, 14, 26, 45, 50, 66, 77, 77, 79, 84, 85]
```

This is a simple example,. In fact, given the amount of data being manipulated, it might be faster to simply build the list and then sort it once. By contrast, for long lists, significant time and memory savings can be achieved using an insertion sort algorithm such as this, especially when the operation to compare two members of the list requires expensive computation.
