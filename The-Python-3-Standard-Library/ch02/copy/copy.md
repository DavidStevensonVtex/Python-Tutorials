## [2.9 copy â€” Duplicate Objects](https://pymotw.com/3/copy/index.html)

Purpose:	Provides functions for duplicating objects using shallow or deep copy semantics.

The copy module includes two functions, copy() and deepcopy(), for duplicating existing objects.

### 2.9.1 Shallow Copies

The shallow copy created by copy() is a new container populated with references to the contents of the original object. When making a shallow copy of a list object, a new list is constructed and the elements of the original object are appended to it.

```
# copy_shallow.py
import copy
import functools


@functools.total_ordering
class MyClass:

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.name == other.name

    def __gt__(self, other):
        return self.name > other.name


a = MyClass('a')
my_list = [a]
dup = copy.copy(my_list)

print('             my_list:', my_list)
print('                 dup:', dup)
print('      dup is my_list:', (dup is my_list))
print('      dup == my_list:', (dup == my_list))
print('dup[0] is my_list[0]:', (dup[0] is my_list[0]))
print('dup[0] == my_list[0]:', (dup[0] == my_list[0]))
```

For a shallow copy, the MyClass instance is not duplicated, so the reference in the dup list is to the same object that is in my_list.

```
$ python3 copy_shallow.py
             my_list: [<__main__.MyClass object at 0x7f35f71d3040>]
                 dup: [<__main__.MyClass object at 0x7f35f71d3040>]
      dup is my_list: False
      dup == my_list: True
dup[0] is my_list[0]: True
dup[0] == my_list[0]: True
```

### 2.9.2 Deep Copies

The deep copy created by deepcopy() is a new container populated with copies of the contents of the original object. To make a deep copy of a list, a new list is constructed, the elements of the original list are copied, and then those copies are appended to the new list.

Replacing the call to copy() with deepcopy() makes the difference in the output apparent.

```
# copy_deep.py
import copy
import functools


@functools.total_ordering
class MyClass:

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.name == other.name

    def __gt__(self, other):
        return self.name > other.name


a = MyClass('a')
my_list = [a]
dup = copy.deepcopy(my_list)

print('             my_list:', my_list)
print('                 dup:', dup)
print('      dup is my_list:', (dup is my_list))
print('      dup == my_list:', (dup == my_list))
print('dup[0] is my_list[0]:', (dup[0] is my_list[0]))
print('dup[0] == my_list[0]:', (dup[0] == my_list[0]))
```

The first element of the list is no longer the same object reference, but when the two objects are compared they still evaluate as being equal.

```
$ python3 copy_deep.py
             my_list: [<__main__.MyClass object at 0x7fd73977b040>]
                 dup: [<__main__.MyClass object at 0x7fd73966b9a0>]
      dup is my_list: False
      dup == my_list: True
dup[0] is my_list[0]: False
dup[0] == my_list[0]: True
```
