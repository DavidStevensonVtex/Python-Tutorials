## [7.4 sqlite3 â€” Embedded Relational Database](https://pymotw.com/3/sqlite3/index.html)

Purpose:	Implements an embedded relational database with SQL support.

The sqlite3 module implements a [Python DB-API 2.0](https://peps.python.org/pep-0249/) compliant interface to SQLite, an in-process relational database. SQLite is designed to be embedded in applications, instead of using a separate database server program such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle. It is fast, rigorously tested, and flexible, making it suitable for prototyping and production deployment for some applications.
