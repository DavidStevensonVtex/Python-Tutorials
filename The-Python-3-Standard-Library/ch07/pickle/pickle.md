## [7.1 pickle â€” Object Serialization](https://pymotw.com/3/pickle/index.html)

Purpose:	Object serialization

The pickle module implements an algorithm for turning an arbitrary Python object into a series of bytes. This process is also called serializing the object. The byte stream representing the object can then be transmitted or stored, and later reconstructed to create a new object with the same characteristics.

Warning

The documentation for pickle makes clear that it offers no security guarantees. In fact, unpickling data can execute arbitrary code. Be careful using pickle for inter-process communication or data storage, and do not trust data that cannot be verified as secure. See the hmac module for an example of a secure way to verify the source of a pickled data source.

### 7.1.1 Encoding and Decoding Data in Strings

This first example Uses dumps() to encode a data structure as a string, then prints the string to the console. It uses a data structure made up of entirely built-in types. Instances of any class can be pickled, as will be illustrated in a later example.

```
# pickle_string.py
import pickle
import pprint

data = [{"a": "A", "b": 2, "c": 3.0}]
print("DATA:", end=" ")
pprint.pprint(data)

data_string = pickle.dumps(data)
print("PICKLE: {!r}".format(data_string))
```

By default, the pickle will be written in a binary format most compatible when sharing between Python 3 programs.

```
$ python3 pickle_string.py
DATA: [{'a': 'A', 'b': 2, 'c': 3.0}]
PICKLE: b'\x80\x04\x95#\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00]\x94}\x94(\x8c\x01a\x94\x8c\x01A\x94\x8c\x01b\x94K\x02\x8c\x01c\x94G@\x08\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00ua.'
```

After the data is serialized, it can be written to a file, socket, pipe, etc. Later, the file can be read and the data unpickled to construct a new object with the same values.

```
# pickle_unpickle.py
import pickle
import pprint

data1 = [{"a": "A", "b": 2, "c": 3.0}]
print("BEFORE: ", end=" ")
pprint.pprint(data1)

data1_string = pickle.dumps(data1)

data2 = pickle.loads(data1_string)
print("AFTER : ", end=" ")
pprint.pprint(data2)

print("SAME? :", (data1 is data2))
print("EQUAL?:", (data1 == data2))
```

The newly constructed object is equal to, but not the same object as, the original.

```
$ python3 pickle_unpickle.py
BEFORE:  [{'a': 'A', 'b': 2, 'c': 3.0}]
AFTER :  [{'a': 'A', 'b': 2, 'c': 3.0}]
SAME? : False
EQUAL?: True
```
