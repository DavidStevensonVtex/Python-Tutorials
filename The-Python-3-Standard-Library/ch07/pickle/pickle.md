## [7.1 pickle â€” Object Serialization](https://pymotw.com/3/pickle/index.html)

Purpose:	Object serialization

The pickle module implements an algorithm for turning an arbitrary Python object into a series of bytes. This process is also called serializing the object. The byte stream representing the object can then be transmitted or stored, and later reconstructed to create a new object with the same characteristics.

Warning

The documentation for pickle makes clear that it offers no security guarantees. In fact, unpickling data can execute arbitrary code. Be careful using pickle for inter-process communication or data storage, and do not trust data that cannot be verified as secure. See the hmac module for an example of a secure way to verify the source of a pickled data source.
