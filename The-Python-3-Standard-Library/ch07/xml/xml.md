## [7.5 xml.etree.ElementTree — XML Manipulation API](https://pymotw.com/3/xml.etree.ElementTree/index.html)

Purpose:	Generate and parse XML documents

The ElementTree library includes tools for parsing XML using event-based and document-based APIs, searching parsed documents with XPath expressions, and creating new or modifying existing documents.
