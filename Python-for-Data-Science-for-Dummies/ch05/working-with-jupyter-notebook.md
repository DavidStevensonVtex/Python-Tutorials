## Chapter 5: Working with Jupyter Notebook

### Using Jupyter Notebook The Jupyter Notebook Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is part of the Anaconda suite of tools.

#### Working with Styles

You can use Notebook to create sections and add styles so that the output is nicely formatted. What you end up with is a good-looking report that just happens to contain executable code.

The default style for a cell is Code. However, when you click the down arrow next to the Code entry, you see a listing of styles.

* Code
* Markdown
* [Raw NBConvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* Heading

The goal of the Raw NBConvert style is to allow you to include special content, such as Lamport TeX (LaTeX) content. The LaTeX document system isn't tied to a particular editor -- it's simply a means of encoding scientific documents.

#### Getting Python Help

To obtain help, select one of the entries on the Help menu.
* [Notebook Help](https://nbviewer.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/3.x/examples/Notebook/Index.ipynb)
* [Markdown] (https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github)
* [Python Reference](https://docs.python.org/3.10/)
* [IPython Reference](https://ipython.org/documentation.html)

#### Using magic functions

Jupyter provides a special feature called magic functions.

##### Obtaining the magic functions list

The best way to start working with magic functions is to obtain a list of them by typing `%quickref` and pressing enter.

```
IPython -- An enhanced Interactive Python - Quick Reference Card
================================================================

obj?, obj??      : Get help, or more help for object (also works as
                   ?obj, ??obj).
?foo.*abc*       : List names in 'foo' containing 'abc' in them.
%magic           : Information about IPython's 'magic' % functions.

Magic functions are prefixed by % or %%, and typically take their arguments
without parentheses, quotes or even commas for convenience.  Line magics take a
single % and cell magics are prefixed with two %%.

Example magic function calls:

%alias d ls -F   : 'd' is now an alias for 'ls -F'
alias d ls -F    : Works if 'alias' not a python name
alist = %alias   : Get list of aliases to 'alist'
cd /usr/share    : Obvious. cd -<tab> to choose from visited dirs.
%cd??            : See help AND source for magic %cd
%timeit x=10     : time the 'x=10' statement with high precision.
%%timeit x=2**100
x**100           : time 'x**100' with a setup of 'x=2**100'; setup code is not
                   counted.  This is an example of a cell magic.

System commands:

!cp a.txt b/     : System command escape, calls os.system()
cp a.txt b/      : after %rehashx, most system commands work without !
cp ${f}.txt $bar : Variable expansion in magics and system commands
files = !ls /usr : Capture system command output
files.s, files.l, files.n: "a b c", ['a','b','c'], 'a\nb\nc'

History:

_i, _ii, _iii    : Previous, next previous, next next previous input
_i4, _ih[2:5]    : Input history line 4, lines 2-4
exec(_i81)       : Execute input history line #81 again
%rep 81          : Edit input history line #81
_, __, ___       : previous, next previous, next next previous output
_dh              : Directory history
_oh              : Output history
%hist            : Command history of current session.
%hist -g foo     : Search command history of (almost) all sessions for 'foo'.
%hist -g         : Command history of (almost) all sessions.
%hist 1/2-8      : Command history containing lines 2-8 of session 1.
%hist 1/ ~2/     : Command history of session 1 and 2 sessions before current.
%hist ~8/1-~6/5  : Command history from line 1 of 8 sessions ago to
                   line 5 of 6 sessions ago.
%edit 0/         : Open editor to execute code with history of current session.

Autocall:

f 1,2            : f(1,2)  # Off by default, enable with %autocall magic.
/f 1,2           : f(1,2) (forced autoparen)
,f 1 2           : f("1","2")
;f 1 2           : f("1 2")

Remember: TAB completion works in many contexts, not just file names
or python names.

##### Working with magic functions

Most magic functions start with either a single percent sign (%) or two percent signs (%%).
Those with a single percent sign work at the command-line level, and the ones with two percent signs work at the cell level. You generally use magic functions with a single percent sign.

To change directories, you type `%cd <new-directory>`.

#### Discovering Objects

It's a good idea to know how to discover what object you're workign with and what features it provides.

##### Getting object help

You can request information about specific objects using the object name and a question mark (?).

Enter the following Python code into a Code cell in a Jupyter Notebook.

```
mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist?
```

```
Type:        list
String form: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
Length:      3
Docstring:  
Built-in mutable sequence.

If no argument is given, the constructor creates a new empty list.
The argument must be an iterable if specified.
```

When you need detailed help about `mylist`, you type `help(mylist)` and click Run.

```
help(mylist)
```

```

##### Obtaining object specifics

The `dir()` function is often overlooked, but it's an essential way to learn about object specifics.
Use `dir(<object-name>)`.

##### Using extended Python object help

Using a single question mark causes Python to clip long content. If you want to obtain the full content for an object, you need to use the double question mark (??).

`mylist??`

#### Restarting the kernel

Every time you perform a task in your notebook, you create variables, import modules, and perform a wealth of other tasks that modify the environemtn. At some point, you can't really be sure that something is working as it should. To overcome this problem, you save your document by clicking Save and Checkpoint (the button containing a floppy disk symbol), and then click Restart Kernel (the button with an open circle with an arrow at one end).

Whenever you click Restart Kernel, you see a warning message. Make sure to pay attention to the warning because you could lose temporary changes during a kernel restart. Always save your document before you restart the kernel.

#### Restoring a checkpoint

At some point, you may find that you made a mistake. Notebook is notably missing an Undo button: You won't find one anywhere. Instead, you create checkpoints each time you finish a tas. Creating checkpoints when your document is stable and workign properly helps you recover faster from mistakes.

To restore your setup to the condition contained in a checkpoint, choose File-> Revert to Checkpoint. You see a listing of available checkpoints. Simply select the one you want to use. When you select the checkpoint, you see a warning message. When you click Revert, any old information is gone and the information found in the checkpoint becomes the current information.

### Performing Multimedia and Graphic Integration

Pictures say a lot of things that words can't say (or at least they do it with far less effort). Notebook is both a coding platform and presentation platform.
