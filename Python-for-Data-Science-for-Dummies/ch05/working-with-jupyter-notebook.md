## Chapter 5: Working with Jupyter Notebook

### Using Jupyter Notebook The Jupyter Notebook Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is part of the Anaconda suite of tools.

#### Working with Styles

You can use Notebook to create sections and add styles so that the output is nicely formatted. What you end up with is a good-looking report that just happens to contain executable code.

The default style for a cell is Code. However, when you click the down arrow next to the Code entry, you see a listing of styles.

* Code
* Markdown
* [Raw NBConvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* Heading

The goal of the Raw NBConvert style is to allow you to include special content, such as Lamport TeX (LaTeX) content. The LaTeX document system isn't tied to a particular editor -- it's simply a means of encoding scientific documents.
