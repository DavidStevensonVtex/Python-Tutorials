## Chapter 4: Working with Google Colab

Colaboratory, or [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) for short, is a free Google cloud-based service that replaces Jupyter Notebook in the cloud. You don't have to install anything on your system to use it. In most respects, you use Colab as you would a desktop installation of Jupyter Notebook.

### Defining Google Colab

Google Colab is the cloud version of Notebook. It even uses IPython (the previous name for Jupyter) Notebook (.ipynb) file for the site.  That's right: You're viewing a Notebook right there in your browser.

#### Understanding what Google Colab does

You use it to write and run code, create its associated documentation, and display graphics, just as you do with Notebook. There are small differences between Google Colab and Jupyter Notebook.

Notebook is a localized application.

Colab enables you to fully interact with your notebook files using GitHub as a repository. In fact, Colab supports a number of online storage options, so you can regard Colab as your online partner in creating Python code.

The other reason that you really need to know about Colab is that you can use it with your alternative device. During the writing process, some of the example code was tested on an Android-based tablet. The target tablet has Chrome installed and executes the code well enough to follow the examples. All this said, you likely won't want to try to write code using a tablet.

Google Colab generally doesn't work with browsers other than Chrome or Firefox.
