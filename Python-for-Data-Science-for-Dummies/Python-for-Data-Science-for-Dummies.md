# Python for Data Science for Dummies, 3rd Edition, Â© 2024

## Introduction

Part of the emphasis of this book is on using the right tools. You start with either Jupyter Notebook (on desktop systems) or Google Colab (on the web) -- two tools that take the sting out of working with Python.

The code you place in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab is presentation quality and you can mix a number of presentation elements right there in your document. 

You can create plots of all your data using Matplotlib.

You can use Scikitlearn to perform some very interesting calculations.

The third edition of this book provides you with updated examples using Python 3.x so that you're using the most modern version of Python while reading.

This edition of the book contains updated datasets that better demonstrate how data science works today. This edition also touches on modern concerns, such as removing personally identifiable information and enhancing data security.

### Foolish Assumptions

Chapter 3 provides Anaconda installation instructions, which supports Jupyter Notebook, and Chapter 4 gets you started with Google Colab.

**Python Tutorials**

* [W3Schools - Python](https://www.w3schools.com/python/)
* [Tutorialspoint Python](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/)

This book isn't a math primer. Yes, you do encounter some complex math, but the emphasis is on helping you use Python and data science to perform analysis tasks rather than teaching math theory.

### Beyond the Book

This book isn't the end of your Python or data science experience -- it's really just the beginning. We  provide online content to make this book more flexible and better able to meet your needs.
