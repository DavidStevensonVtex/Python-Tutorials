## Chapter 7: Processing Your Data

The characteristics, content, type, and other elements that define your data in its entirety forms the data _shape_. The shape of your data determines the kinds of tasks you can perform with it.

You rely on functions and algorithms to shape your data.

Note that shaping data doesn't mean changing its value. Think more allong the lines of rearranging the data so that you can work with it in an easier manner.

The goal of some types of data shaping is to create a larger dataset. In many cases, the data you need to perform an analysis doesn't appear in a single database or in a particular form. You need to shape the data and then combine it so that you have a single dataset in a known format before you can begin the analysis.
