## Chapter 2: Introducing Python's Capabilities and Wodners

### Working with Python

#### Contributing to Data Science

[Understanding How Python is Used in Data Science](https://www.datasciencegraduateprograms.com/python/)

Here are the reasons [ForecastWatch.com](https://forecastwatch.com/) chose Python:

* Library support: [Python Success Stories](https://www.python.org/about/success/forecastwatch/)
* Parallel Processing
* Data access: Forecast.com relies on a MySQL database accessed through the [MySQL for Python](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/) library. [MySQL with Python 3.x - mysqlclient](https://pypi.org/project/mysqlclient/).
* Data display

#### Getting a taste of the language

This book relies on a much better environment, Jupyter Notebook (or Google Colab as an alternative).

#### Understanding the need for indentation

One of the most common errors that developers encounter is not providing the proper indentation for code.

#### Working with Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab

The vast majority of this book relies on Jupyter Notebook (with code also tested using Google Colab), which is part of the Anaconda installation you create in Chapter 3.

### Performing Rapid Prototyping and Experimentation

Python is all about creating applications quickly and then experimenting with them to see how things work. The act of creating an application design in code without necessarily filling in all the details is _prototyping_.

Data science doesn't rely on static solutions. You may have to try multiple solutiosn to find the particular solutin that works best.

The following list shows the phases in the order in which you normally perform them.

1. Building a data pipeline.
2. Performing the required shaping. The shape of the data -- the way in which it appears and its characteristics (such as data type), is important in performing analysis.
3. Analyzing the data. When analyzing data, you seldom employ a single algorithm and call it good enough. You can't know which algorithm will produce the most useful results at the outset.
4. Presenting a result. A picture is worth a thousand words, or so they say. Using the MATLAB-like plotting functionality provided by the Matplotlib library, you can create multiple presentations of the same data, each of which describes the data graphically in different ways.

[MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) is a widely used mathematical modeling program; see MATLAB For Dummies, 2nd Edition.
