## Chapter 2: Introducing Python's Capabilities and Wodners

### Working with Python

#### Contributing to Data Science

[Understanding How Python is Used in Data Science](https://www.datasciencegraduateprograms.com/python/)

Here are the reasons [ForecastWatch.com](https://forecastwatch.com/) chose Python:

* Library support: [Python Success Stories](https://www.python.org/about/success/forecastwatch/)
* Parallel Processing
* Data access: Forecast.com relies on a MySQL database accessed through the [MySQL for Python](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/) library. [MySQL with Python 3.x - mysqlclient](https://pypi.org/project/mysqlclient/).
* Data display

#### Getting a taste of the language

This book relies on a much better environment, Jupyter Notebook (or Google Colab as an alternative).

#### Understanding the need for indentation

One of the most common errors that developers encounter is not providing the proper indentation for code.

### Working with Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab

The vast majority of this book relies on Jupyter Notebook (with code also tested using Google Colab), which is part of the Anaconda installation you create in Chapter 3.
