## Chapter 3: Setting Up Python for Data Science

This book relies on Jupyter Notebook version 6.5.2 supplied with the Anaconda 3 environment (version 2023.03) that supports the Python version 3.10.9 to create the coding examples.

### Working with Anaconda

Anaconda is actually a collection of tools as described at https://www.anaconda.com/products/navigator

#### Using Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook is an Integrated Development Environment that promotes the concept of [literate programming](https://guides.nyu.edu/datascience/literate-prog) as original defined by Donalk Knuth.

```
import sys
print('Python Version:\n', sys.version)

import os
result = os.popen('conda --version').read()
print('\nAnaconda Version: \n', result)

result =os.popen('conda list notebook$').read()
print('\nJupyter Notebook Version:\n', result)
```

```
$ python3 version-check.py 
Python Version:
 3.10.9 (main, Mar  1 2023, 18:23:06) [GCC 11.2.0]

Anaconda Version: 
 conda 23.1.0


Jupyter Notebook Version:
 # packages in environment at /home/dstevenson/anaconda3:
#
# Name                    Version                   Build  Channel
notebook                  6.5.2           py310h06a4308_0  
```

#### Accessing the Anaconda Prompt

You use the Anaconda Prompt to perform many command-line tasks related to working with Jupyter Notebook. The Anaconda Prompt provides a gateway to allowing maximum flexibility withyour Python programming environment, which is a significant advantage over using Google Colab (where it's a take-it-or-leave-it proposition).

### Installing Anaconda on Windows

### Installing Anaconda on Linux

Before you can perform the install, you must download a copy of the Linux software from the Anaconda site at https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/.

On most Linux systems, you can type 

`curl https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2023.03-Linux-x86_64.sh --output Anaconda3-2023.03-Linux-x86_64.sh`

### Downloading the Datasets and Example Code

#### Using Jupyter Notebook

The program runs in your browser, so which platform you use for development doesn't matter; as long as it has a browser, you should be OK.

On a Windows system, you choose Start -> Jupyter Notebook or Start | Anaconda3 | Jupyter.

On Linux type:

`jupyter notebook`

#### Stopping the Jupyter Notebook server

No matter how you start Jupyter Notebook (or just Notebook, as it appears in the remaidner of the book), the system generally opens a command prompt or internal window to host Notebook. This window contains a server that makes the application work. After you close the browser window when a session is complete, select the server window and press Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Break to stop the server.

To exit the conda environment, type `conda deactivate` and press Enter.

#### Defining the code repository

The code you create and use in this book will reside in a repository on your hard drive. 

##### Defining a new folder

In Jupyter Notebook (see web browser):

1. Choose New->Folder.
2. Place a check in the box next to Untitled Folder
3. Click Rename at the top of the page.
4. Type P4DS4D3 and press Enter.

#### Creating a new notebook

Every new notebook is like a file folder. You can place individual examples in the file folder, just as you would sheets of paper into a physical file folder.

Use these steps to create a new notebook.

1. Click the P4DS4D3 entry on the Home page.
2. Choose New->Python 3 (ipykernel).
3. Click Untitled on the page.
4. Type P4DS4D3_Sample and press Enter.
