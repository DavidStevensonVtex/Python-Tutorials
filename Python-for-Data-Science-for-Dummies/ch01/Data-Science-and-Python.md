## Chapter 1: Discovering the Match between Data Science and Python

Data science involves the use of advanced math techniques, statistics and big data.
However, data science also involves helping you make smart decisions, creating suggestions for options based on previous choices, and making robots see objects.

To make data science doable by someone who's less than a math genius, you need tools.

Python provides an incredible number of math-related libraries that help you perform tasks with a less than perfect understanding of precisely what is going on. PPython goes further by supporting multiple coding styles (programming paradigms) and doing other things to make your job easier.

### Understanding Python as a Language

Common wisdom ways that Python is interpreted, but Python can cact as a compiled language as well.
This book uses Jupyter Notebook because the environment works well for learning.

#### Viewing Python's various uses as a general-purpose language

Python isn't a language just for use in data science; it's a general-purpose langauge with many uses beyond what you need to perform data science tasks.

Developers commonly use Python to perform:

* Web development
* General-purpose programming
  * Performing Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations
  * Creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
  * Developing application programming interfaces (APIs)
* Game Development
* Automation and scripting
* Software testing and prototyping
* Language development (Cobra, CoffeeScript, and Go all use a language syntax similar to Python)
* Marketing and Search Engine Optimization
* Common tasks associated with standard applications:
  * Tracking financial transactions
  * Interacting with various types of messaging strategies
  * Creating various kinds of lists based on environmental or other inputs
  * Automating tasks like filling out forms

#### Interpreting Python

##### [Literate Programming](https://notebook.community/sfomel/ipython/LiterateProgramming)

"Literate programming is a concept promoted by Donald Knuth, the famous computer scientist (and the author of the Art of Computer Programming.) According to this concept, computer programs should be written in a combination of the programming language (the usual source code) and the natural language, which explains the logic of the program."

#### Commpiling Python

Outside this book, you may find that compiling your Python application is important because doing so can help increase overall application speed.

You do need access to third-party products to compile your code.

### Defining Data Science

#### Considering the emergence of data science

William S. Cleveland coined th term in 2001 as part of a paper entitled "Data Science: An Action Plan for Expanding the Technical Areas of the Field of Statistics."

Columbia got into the act in 2003 by beginning publication of the [Journal of Data Science](https://jds-online.org/journal/JDS).

However, the mathematical basis behind data science is centuries old because data science is essentially a method of viewing analyzing statisitcs and probability.

#### Outlining the core competencies of a data scientist

It would be hard to find a single person with all the required skills.

* Data capture. Data-modeling skills.
* Analysis. Use basic statistical tool skills.
* Presentation. It's important to provide a graphical presentation of these patterns to help others visualize what the numbers mean and how to apply them in a meaningful way. More important, the presentation must tell a specific story so that the impact of the data isn't lost.

#### Linking data science, big data, and AI

Interestingly enough, the act of moving data around so that someone can perform analysis on it is a specialty called Extract, Transformation, and Loading (ETL). Tools such as Informatica, MS SSIS, or Teradata.

### Creating the Data Science Pipeline

* Preparing the data
* Performing exploratory data analysis
* Learning from data
* Visualizing: Visualisation means seeing the patterns in the data and then being able to react to those patterns. It also means being able to see when data is not part of the pattern.
* Obtaining insights and data products. The process doesn't end until you have a clear understanding of what the data means. For example, you can use the results of an analysis to make a business decision.
