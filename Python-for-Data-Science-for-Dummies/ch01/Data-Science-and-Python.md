# Chapter 1: Discovering the Match between Data Science and Python

Data science involves the use of advanced math techniques, statistics and big data.
However, data science also involves helping you make smart decisions, creating suggestions for options based on previous choices, and making robots see objects.

To make data science doable by someone who's less than a math genius, you need tools.

Python provides an incredible number of math-related libraries that help you perform tasks with a less than perfect understanding of precisely what is going on. PPython goes further by supporting multiple coding styles (programming paradigms) and doing other things to make your job easier.
