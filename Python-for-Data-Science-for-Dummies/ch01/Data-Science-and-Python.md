## Chapter 1: Discovering the Match between Data Science and Python

Data science involves the use of advanced math techniques, statistics and big data.
However, data science also involves helping you make smart decisions, creating suggestions for options based on previous choices, and making robots see objects.

To make data science doable by someone who's less than a math genius, you need tools.

Python provides an incredible number of math-related libraries that help you perform tasks with a less than perfect understanding of precisely what is going on. PPython goes further by supporting multiple coding styles (programming paradigms) and doing other things to make your job easier.

### Understanding Python as a Language

Common wisdom ways that Python is interpreted, but Python can cact as a compiled language as well.
This book uses Jupyter Notebook because the environment works well for learning.

#### Viewing Python's various uses as a general-purpose language

Python isn't a language just for use in data science; it's a general-purpose langauge with many uses beyond what you need to perform data science tasks.

Developers commonly use Python to perform:

* Web development
* General-purpose programming
  * Performing Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations
  * Creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
  * Developing application programming interfaces (APIs)
* Game Development
* Automation and scripting
* Software testing and prototyping
* Language development (Cobra, CoffeeScript, and Go all use a language syntax similar to Python)
* Marketing and Search Engine Optimization
* Common tasks associated with standard applications:
  * Tracking financial transactions
  * Interacting with various types of messaging strategies
  * Creating various kinds of lists based on environmental or other inputs
  * Automating tasks like filling out forms
