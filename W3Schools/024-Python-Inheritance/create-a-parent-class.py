# Python Inheritance

# Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.

# Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.

# Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

# Create a Parent Class

# Any class can be a parent class, so the syntax is the same as creating any other class:

# Create a class named Person, with firstname and lastname properties, and a printname method:

class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

# Use the Person class to create an object, and then execute the printname method:

x = Person("John", "Doe")
x.printname()

# Add the __init__() Function

# So far we have created a child class that inherits the properties and methods from its parent.

# We want to add the __init__() function to the child class (instead of the pass keyword).

# Note: The __init__() function is called automatically every time the class is being used to create a new object.

# Example
# Add the __init__() function to the Student class:

# When you add the __init__() function, the child class will no longer inherit the 
# parent's __init__() function.

# Note: The child's __init__() function overrides the inheritance of the 
# parent's __init__() function.

# To keep the inheritance of the parent's __init__() function, add a call 
# to the parent's __init__() function:

# Example
class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    Person.__init__(self, fname, lname)

s = Student("Sam", "Spade")
s.printname()

# $ python3 create-a-parent-class.py 
# John Doe
# Sam Spade
