# The range() Function
# To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function,
# The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments 
# by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.

# Example
# Using the range() function:

for x in range(6):
  print(x)

# Note that range(6) is not the values of 0 to 6, but the values 0 to 5.

# $ python3 range.py 
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
