# Python Inheritance

# Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.

# Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.

# Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

# Create a Parent Class

# Any class can be a parent class, so the syntax is the same as creating any other class:

# Create a class named Person, with firstname and lastname properties, and a printname method:

class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

# Use the Person class to create an object, and then execute the printname method:

x = Person("John", "Doe")
x.printname()

# Add Methods

# Add a method called welcome to the Student class:

class Student(Person):
  def __init__(self, fname, lname, year):
    super().__init__(fname, lname)
    self.graduationyear = year

  def welcome(self):
    print("Welcome", self.firstname, self.lastname, "to the class of", self.graduationyear)

s = Student("Mike", "Olsen", 2019)
s.welcome()

# $ python3 create-a-parent-class.py 
# John Doe
# Welcome Mike Olsen to the class of 2019
