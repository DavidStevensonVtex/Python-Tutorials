# Dictionary Items
# Dictionary items are ordered, changeable, and do not allow duplicates.

# Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.

# Example
# Print the "brand" value of the dictionary:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict["brand"])

# $ python3 dictionary-items.py 
# Ford
