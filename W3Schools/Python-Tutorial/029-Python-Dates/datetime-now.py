# Python Dates

# A date in Python is not a data type of its own, but we can import a module named 
# datetime to work with dates as date objects.

# Import the datetime module and display the current date:

import datetime

x = datetime.datetime.now()
print(x)

# $ python3 datetime-now.py 
# 2025-01-21 09:19:55.522254
