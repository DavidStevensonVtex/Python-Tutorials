# Python String Formatting

# F-String was introduced in Python 3.6, and is now the preferred way of formatting strings.

# Before Python 3.6 we had to use the format() method.

# F-Strings
# F-string allows you to format selected parts of a string.

# To specify a string as an f-string, simply put an f in front of the string literal, like this:

# Create an f-string:

txt = f"The price is 49 dollars"
print(txt)

# $ python3 f-strings.py 
# The price is 49 dollars
