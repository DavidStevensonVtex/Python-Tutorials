# Placeholders and Modifiers

# To format values in an f-string, add placeholders {}, a placeholder can contain variables, operations, functions, and modifiers to format the value.

# Example

# Add a placeholder for the price variable:

price = 59
txt = f"The price is {price} dollars"
print(txt)

# $ python3 placeholders.py 
# The price is 59 dollars
