# The Math Module

# Python has also a built-in module called math, which extends the list of mathematical functions.

# To use it, you must import the math module:

# import math
# When you have imported the math module, you can start using methods and constants of the module.

# The math.sqrt() method for example, returns the square root of a number:

# Example

import math

x = math.sqrt(64)
print(x)

# $ python3 math-module.py 
# 8.0
