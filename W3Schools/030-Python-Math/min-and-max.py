# Python Math

# Python has a set of built-in math functions, including an extensive math module, 
# that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.

# Built-in Math Functions

# The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in 
# an iterable:

x = min(5, 10, 25)
y = max(5, 10, 25)

print(x)
print(y)

# $ python3 min-and-max.py 
# 5
# 25
