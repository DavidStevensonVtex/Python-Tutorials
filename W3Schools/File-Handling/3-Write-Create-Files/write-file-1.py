# Python File Write
# Write to an Existing File
# To write to an existing file, you must add a parameter to the open() function:

# "a" - Append - will append to the end of the file
# "w" - Write - will overwrite any existing content

# Open the file "demofile2.txt" and append content to the file:

f = open("demofile2.txt", "a")
f.write("Now the file has more content!")
f.close()

#open and read the file after the appending:
f = open("demofile2.txt", "r")
print(f.read())

# $ python3 write-file-1.py 
# Now the file has more content!
