## [Python Operators](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp)

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

* Arithmetic operators
* Assignment operators
* Comparison operators
* Logical operators
* Identity operators
* Membership operators
* Bitwise operators

### Python Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

Operator	Name	Example
* \+	Addition	x + y	
* \-	Subtraction	x - y	
* \*	Multiplication	x * y	
* \/	Division	x / y	
* \%	Modulus	x % y	
* \*\*	Exponentiation	x ** y	
* \/\/	Floor division	x // y

### Python Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:

Operator	Example	Same As
* =	x = 5	x = 5	
* +=	x += 3	x = x + 3	
* -=	x -= 3	x = x - 3	
* *=	x *= 3	x = x * 3	
* /=	x /= 3	x = x / 3	
* %=	x %= 3	x = x % 3	
* //=	x //= 3	x = x // 3	
* **=	x **= 3	x = x ** 3	
* &=	x &= 3	x = x & 3	
* |=	x |= 3	x = x | 3	
* ^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3	
* \>\>=	x \>\>= 3	x = x \>\> 3	
* \<\<=	x \<\<= 3	x = x \<\< 3	
* :=	print(x := 3)	x = 3 print(x)

### Python Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

Operator	Name	Example
* ==	Equal	x == y	
* !=	Not equal	x != y	
* \>	Greater than	x \> y	
* \<	Less than	x \< y	
* \>=	Greater than or equal to	x \>= y	
* \<=	Less than or equal to	x \<= y
